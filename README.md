# Raining Python - rainpy
Raining Python - A combination of Python and HTML, all for weather analysis

### **Information about using the files can be found below the text**

This project is experimental, for training purposes, and there will always be changes to the source code or overall design.

The project aims to experiment with different methods of data collection, analysis and overall text transformation. The data passes through the script to the server (localhost) and is displayed on the HTML page.

Materials used:

Python modules:

- [x] Flask: A web framework that allows you to create dynamic web applications in Python.
- [ ] Jinja2 (coming soon): A template engine that makes it easy to insert dynamic data into HTML templates.
- [ ] Colorama (coming soon): A module or tool that can be used for further data processing or analysis.

The project is available under an Open Source license, which means that anyone can use it as a base template that is enriched with additional functions as it develops.

Latest additions:

- [x] HTML page
- [ ] Adding an admin interface to the command line (coming soon): It is planned to implement an interface enabling project management from the command line.
- [ ] Terrain selection menu for checking data (coming soon): Functionality is planned to allow the user to select different geographical locations to check weather data.
- [ ] Enhanced UI (coming soon): The project will be gradually enhanced with a more advanced and attractive UI.
